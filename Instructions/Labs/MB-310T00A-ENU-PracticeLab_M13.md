5.  In the **Fee description** field, type a value. This description provides
    more detail about when the fee is assessed.

6.  In the **Charge** field, select either **Vendor** or **Ledger**. **Vendor**
    is used when the fee will be assessed to the vendor. **Ledger** is used when
    the fee will be expensed to your organization.

7.  Enter a main account for where the fee will be expensed. This option is only
    available when selecting **Ledger** as the **Charge** option.

8.  Select the journal on which this fee can be used. For a vendor payment fee,
    you would select the journal **Vendor disbursement**.
